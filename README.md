# nPuzzle
The 8-puzzle is an instance of the n-puzzle problem, where eight tiles are placed on a 3x3 grid. The remaining un-tiled position is an empty space. Tiles adjacent to the empty space may be moved into that space. The puzzle is solved by finding a sequence of moves that will transform the initial state into the given goal state.

Used algorithm: IDA*.
